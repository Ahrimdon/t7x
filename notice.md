# T7x will no longer receive updates

It is with deep regret that I must inform you that I have received a formal complaint from the original copyright holder of the source code. T7x is a project that utilizes source code from another defunct project called "boiii," licensed under the GPLv3.

I hold deep respect for the immense amount of work and time invested by the previous developer in reverse-engineering and enabling the game to be modded to the extent this client allows. Therefore, I am honoring the claim that I cannot use boiii's technology.

As part of the agreement, this project is to be *ARCHIVED IMMEDIATELY*, and it will no longer receive any updates or support.

It was also a agreed that this notice shall remain, informing the public that I am not discontinuing this client due to an action by a specific American video game corporation.

All the involved parties wish that any further attempts at creating a modded client for Black Ops 3 allocate time and effort into developing their own technology rather than utilizing boiii's source code.
